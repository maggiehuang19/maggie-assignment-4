# Dining Out in Manhattan Community Board 3

Dining Out NYC is the city's now-permanent outdoor dining program, overseen by NYC DOT. With the new program, applications for outdoor dining are mandated to be sent to the affected Community Boards for feedback and recommendations for approval or denial of an outdoor dining license. 

This map shows the state of outdoor dining in Manhattan's Community Board 3, encompassing parts of East Village, Chinatown, and Lower East Side.
